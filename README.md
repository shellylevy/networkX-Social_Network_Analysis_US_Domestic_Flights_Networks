# networkX - Social Network Analysis US Domestic Flights Networks
This project explores the US domestic airline network, analyzing airport centrality's impact on flight delays using Python's NetworkX for Social Network Analysis. The goal is to enhance operational efficiency and guide dynamic pricing for flight delay insurance.

## Objective:
The primary objective of this research project at Reichman University was to explore the intricate dynamics of the US domestic airline network. The focus was on understanding how the structural attributes of the network, particularly the centrality of airports, affect flight delay patterns. This exploration aimed to offer valuable insights for improving airline and airport operations and fostering the development of innovative business applications like flight delay insurance.

## Methodology:
Leveraging Python's NetworkX library, we constructed a detailed representation of the US domestic flights network, with nodes representing airports and edges depicting flight routes. Our analysis employed various centrality measures, such as degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality, to identify critical nodes within the network and assess their influence on delay propagation. We further integrated these centrality measures into a linear regression model to explore their predictive power regarding flight delay durations.

## Findings:
Our analysis revealed a significant correlation between airport centrality and the likelihood of flight delays, supporting the hypothesis that more central airports are prone to higher delay frequencies. However, the predictive models indicated that while network structure is an important factor, it alone does not capture the full complexity of delay causation, suggesting the influence of other external and operational factors.

## Business Implications:
The insights gleaned have profound implications for the airline industry and insurtech sector. They highlight the potential for leveraging network analysis in developing dynamic pricing models for flight delay insurance, enhancing customer service, and informing strategic planning and investments in airport infrastructure.

## Conclusion:
This project underscores the value of Social Network Analysis in unraveling the complexities of the airline industry, providing a foundation for data-driven decision-making and innovation in service offerings and operational strategies.
